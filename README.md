💳 AMEX Data Challenge – Preprocessing, Feature Engineering & Analysis  
This repository contains a comprehensive data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) project on the American Express customer dataset, completed as part of the Unstop Practice Project. The goal is to prepare the data, engineer meaningful features, and lay the groundwork for further machine learning applications.

📊 **Project Overview**  
The dataset consists of customer profiles and transactional data provided by American Express. The objective of this project is to explore the data, perform preprocessing, and build a clean foundation for credit risk modeling and behavioral analysis.

---

🔍 **Objectives**
- Understand and explore financial transaction data  
- Clean and preprocess raw, structured datasets  
- Engineer features that may impact model performance  
- Visualize customer behavior and data distributions  
- Prepare the data for machine learning workflows

---

🛠️ **Tools & Technologies Used**
- **Language:** Python  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook  
- **Libraries Used:**
  - `pandas`, `numpy` – data handling and manipulation  
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – data visualization  
  - `scikit-learn` – preprocessing utilities  
  - (Extendable for model building in future phases)
